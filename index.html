      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>One thing I'm passionate about is our planet and her limited natural resources. I try to do my part to limit my waste by recyling, reducing the amount of animal products I consume, taking public transit (when safe) and more. But recently I've wanted to take it a step further and begin composting. I didn't think that was very feasible living in Chicago but it turns out it's relatively easy. 
      <br>  
      <br>
      So for this project I want to create an app that provides information on composting in the city.
      <br>  
      <br>
      I would like to include the following features:
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Reasons why composting is beneficial </li>
        <li>A quiz-like section on what can and can't be composted</li>
        <li>Composting services based on location</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
